Hi {{name}},

I noticed {{company}} is hiring for {{job_title}} ({{location}}). I bring 12+ years of experience in cloud architecture across AWS, Azure, and GCP, with a strong background in AI/ML platforms, DevOps, and hybrid connectivity. 

In my recent roles at AWS and Liberty Global, I’ve helped enterprises design secure landing zones, modernize applications, and build AI-ready infrastructures that align with compliance needs and business outcomes.

I’m very interested in this opportunity and would be glad to discuss how my background as a Senior Cloud & AI Solutions Architect could support {{company}}’s goals.

Best regards,  
Yeferson Bernal
